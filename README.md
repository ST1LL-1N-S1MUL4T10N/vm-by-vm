## 🎯 What’s This?

A Proxmox-based single-node homelab with basic computational resources —  
each VM is a self-contained learning project.  
Minimal setup first, improvements later.  
Documented so you can rebuild anywhere, anytime.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- **One node**: limited resources, max efficiency.  
- **VM per topic**: divide and conquer.  
- **Layered approach**: start simple, iterate often.  
- **Folder structure**:  
  - `/topic-name/` — main folder for each subject  
  - `/topic-name/docs/` — commands, configs, scripts  
  - `/topic-name/ReadMe` — experiments, results, errors

Dive into any topic folder, follow README or docs.

## ⚠️ Be advised

* This is a learning lab — expect rough edges.

* Minimalism prioritized over perfection.
* Use at your own risk.

##  🤝 Philosophy

Information should be free, knowledge is freedom.
This repo is a snapshot of curiosity — take it, use it.

[Build] → [Break] → [Learn] → [Repeat]
